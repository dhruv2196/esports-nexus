# Docker Deployment Summary for Esports Nexus

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Docker Configuration Files

#### Backend Dockerfile (`backend/Dockerfile`)
- Multi-stage build for optimized image size
- Uses Maven 3.9 with Eclipse Temurin JDK 17 for building
- Runtime uses Eclipse Temurin JRE 17 for smaller image
- Non-root user (appuser) for security
- Exposes port 8080

#### Frontend Dockerfile (`frontend/Dockerfile`)
- Multi-stage build with Node.js 18 Alpine for building
- Nginx Alpine for serving the production build
- Custom nginx configuration for SPA routing and API proxy
- Exposes port 80

### 2. Docker Compose Configurations

#### Development Setup (`docker-compose.yml`)
- MongoDB 6.0 with authentication
- Backend service with environment variables
- Frontend service with nginx proxy
- Shared network for service communication
- Persistent volume for MongoDB data

#### Production Setup (`docker-compose.prod.yml`)
- Enhanced with Redis for caching
- Nginx reverse proxy with SSL support
- Health checks for all services
- Resource limits and optimizations
- Multiple replicas support

#### Simple Setup (`docker-compose-simple.yml`)
- MongoDB only for local development
- Useful when running backend/frontend locally

### 3. Environment Configuration

#### `.env` file
- MongoDB credentials
- JWT secret
- OAuth2 credentials (Google, Discord)
- Application settings

#### Application Properties
- `application-docker.properties` for Docker environment
- `application-production.properties` for production
- Configured for MongoDB connection, JWT, OAuth2, and CORS

### 4. Deployment Scripts

#### `deploy.sh`
- Main deployment script with environment selection
- Supports development and production modes
- Actions: up, down, restart, logs, build

#### `health-check.sh`
- Checks the health of all services
- Verifies MongoDB, backend API, and frontend

#### `test-docker.sh`
- Tests Docker setup before deployment
- Validates Docker and Docker Compose installation

### 5. Kubernetes Configuration (in `k8s/` directory)

- **namespace.yaml**: Creates esports-nexus namespace
- **mongodb.yaml**: MongoDB deployment with persistent storage
- **backend.yaml**: Backend deployment with secrets and config
- **frontend.yaml**: Frontend deployment
- **ingress.yaml**: Ingress configuration for routing

### 6. CI/CD Pipeline

#### GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- Automated testing for backend and frontend
- Docker image building and pushing
- Deployment to staging/production

### 7. Production Features

#### Security
- Non-root containers
- Secret management
- SSL/TLS configuration
- Security headers in Nginx

#### Performance
- Multi-stage builds for smaller images
- Nginx caching and compression
- Rate limiting
- Resource limits

#### Monitoring
- Health check endpoints
- Actuator integration
- Logging configuration

## Current Status

The Docker setup is complete and ready for deployment. The backend has been successfully built and cached. The system supports:

1. **Local Development**: Run with Docker Compose
2. **Production Deployment**: Full stack with SSL, caching, and monitoring
3. **Kubernetes Deployment**: Ready for cloud platforms
4. **CI/CD**: Automated build and deployment pipeline

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Development deployment
./deploy.sh development up

# Production deployment
./deploy.sh production up

# Check health
./health-check.sh

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
./deploy.sh development down
```

## Next Steps

1. Configure SSL certificates for production
2. Set up monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
3. Configure backup strategy for MongoDB
4. Set up log aggregation
5. Implement auto-scaling policies

The application is now fully containerized and ready for deployment on any Docker-compatible platform.
