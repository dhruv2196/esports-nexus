- Payment Service: http://localhost:8083
- Legacy Backend: http://localhost:8080
- Frontend: http://localhost:80

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Start All Services
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml up --build
```

### 2. Test Services
```bash
./test-services.sh
```

### 3. Mobile App Development
```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npm start
```

## 🔧 Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
Create `.env` files for each service based on their `.env.example` files:

1. **API Keys Required**:
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - For payment processing
   - `RIOT_API_KEY` - For Valorant integration
   - `PUBG_API_KEY` - For BGMI integration
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` & `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - For AI model storage

2. **Database Credentials**:
   - All services are configured to use the default PostgreSQL credentials
   - Update if using different credentials

## 📊 Database Schema

### PostgreSQL Databases Created:
- `esports_nexus_users` - User authentication and profiles
- `esports_nexus_tournaments` - Tournament data
- `esports_nexus_teams` - Team management
- `esports_nexus_games` - Game integration data
- `esports_nexus_analytics` - AI/ML analytics data
- `esports_nexus_payments` - Payment and subscription data
