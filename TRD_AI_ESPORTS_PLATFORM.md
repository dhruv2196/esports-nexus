## 4. Detailed Technical Specifications

### 4.1 Game Integration (P0/P1)

#### 4.1.1 Valorant
- **Integration Method**: Utilize the official Riot Games API.
- **Authentication**: Implement OAuth2 for players to link their Riot accounts securely. Store tokens in an encrypted format.
- **Data Ingestion**: Develop a serverless pipeline (AWS Lambda + SQS) to pull match history and player stats. Run periodically and on-demand.
- **AI Engine**: The AI/ML service will consume this data to analyze agent picks, team compositions, and predict performance.

#### 4.1.2 Call of Duty Mobile (CODM) & Free Fire
- **Integration Method**: Official APIs are not publicly available.
  - **Primary Strategy**: Partner with third-party data providers if possible.
  - **Secondary Strategy**: Develop a robust and ethical web scraping solution using Python (Scrapy/BeautifulSoup) running on scheduled AWS Fargate tasks. This carries a risk of being blocked.
  - **Contingency**: Allow for manual user input of stats as a fallback.
- **Data Models**: Design flexible data models (JSONB/DynamoDB) to accommodate unstructured data from these sources.

### 4.2 Mobile Application (P0)
- **Framework**: React Native 0.72+.
- **State Management**: Redux with Redux Toolkit for predictable state management.
- **Offline Storage**: `AsyncStorage` for caching profiles, stats, and tournament data.
- **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) integrated via the Notification Service.
- **Authentication**: Implement Biometric authentication using native modules.
- **UI/UX**:
  - **Navigation**: React Navigation for gesture-based navigation.
  - **Theming**: Implement a theming solution (e.g., Styled Components) for Dark/Light modes.

### 4.3 AI-Based Team Matching (P0)
- **Service**: AI/ML Service (Python/FastAPI).
- **Models**:
  - **Player Clustering**: K-means clustering on player stats (KDA, win rate, role) to group similar players. Implemented in Scikit-learn.
  - **Team Recommendation**: Collaborative filtering (using libraries like Surprise or custom TensorFlow models) to suggest teammates based on the successful pairings of other users.
  - **Performance Prediction**: A simple neural network (TensorFlow/Keras) to predict the success probability of a potential team composition.
- **API**: Expose a `/recommend_team` endpoint that accepts a `user_id` and returns a list of compatible players with a "chemistry score".

### 4.4 Advanced Tournament Bracket Visualization (P1)
- **Frontend**: Use D3.js for rendering dynamic, interactive SVG-based brackets.
- **Backend**: The Tournament Service will provide bracket data via a REST API endpoint.
- **Real-time Updates**: Implement a WebSocket connection (using AWS API Gateway WebSocket APIs) to push live score updates and bracket changes to connected clients.

### 4.5 Payment Integration (P0)
- **Provider**: Stripe will be the primary payment processor for its robust API and compliance features.
- **Implementation**:
  - Use Stripe Elements for a secure, PCI-compliant way to collect card information.
  - Use Stripe Connect to manage prize pool payouts to winners.
  - Implement webhooks to listen for payment events (e.g., `payment_intent.succeeded`).
- **Crypto**: For crypto payouts, integrate with a custody/payout service like BitPay to manage wallet interactions and compliance.

## 5. Scalability & Performance

- **API Response Time**: Target a p95 latency of <100ms for all critical API endpoints.
- **Concurrency**: The system will be designed to support 1M+ concurrent users through horizontal scaling of microservices using Kubernetes (EKS).
- **Database Scaling**: Use Amazon RDS read replicas to scale read-heavy workloads. Use DynamoDB for its virtually unlimited scalability for high-volume writes (match data).
- **Load Testing**: Conduct regular load testing using tools like k6 or JMeter to identify and address bottlenecks before launch.
- **CDN**: Use Amazon CloudFront to cache and serve static assets (web app, images) and reduce latency globally.

---

## 6. Security & Compliance

- **Authentication**: All user-facing services will be protected by JWT-based authentication, handled by the API Gateway and User Service.
- **Data Encryption**:
  - **In Transit**: Enforce TLS 1.2+ for all API communication.
  - **At Rest**: Encrypt all data in databases (RDS, DynamoDB) and S3 buckets using AWS KMS.
- **Compliance**:
  - **PCI DSS**: Achieved by using Stripe Elements, ensuring no sensitive card data touches our servers.
  - **GDPR/COPPA**: Implement clear user consent forms, data deletion APIs (`/users/me/delete`), and data export features. Anonymize data used for analytics.
- **Infrastructure Security**:
  - Deploy all services within a private VPC.
  - Use AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) to protect against common exploits (SQLi, XSS).
  - Implement strict IAM roles and policies to enforce the principle of least privilege.

## 8. Deployment & DevOps

### 8.1 CI/CD Pipeline
- **Source Control**: GitHub.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions will be used to automate building, testing, and deploying services.
- **Process**:
  1. Developer pushes code to a feature branch.
  2. Pull request triggers automated tests (unit, integration).
  3. On merge to `main`, a new Docker image is built and pushed to Amazon ECR.
  4. The pipeline then triggers a rolling update to the corresponding service in the EKS cluster.

### 8.2 Environments
- **Development**: Individual developer environments running services locally via Docker Compose.
- **Staging**: A production-like environment in AWS for final testing and QA.
- **Production**: The live environment, deployed across multiple AWS regions for high availability.

## 9. Monitoring & Logging

### 9.1 Logging
- **Strategy**: All microservices will log structured JSON to `stdout`.
- **Aggregation**: A log aggregator like Fluentd will collect logs from all containers and forward them to a centralized logging platform.
- **Platform**: AWS OpenSearch (formerly Elasticsearch) will be used for storing, searching, and analyzing logs.

### 9.2 Monitoring
- **Metrics**: Prometheus will be used to scrape metrics from all services. Key metrics include API latency, error rates, CPU/memory usage, and queue lengths.
- **Dashboards**: Grafana will be used to create dashboards for visualizing metrics and setting up alerts.
- **Alerting**: Prometheus Alertmanager will be configured to send critical alerts to the engineering team via Slack and PagerDuty.
- **Tracing**: Implement distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry to trace requests across microservices, helping to debug performance issues.
